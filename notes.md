The plan was to completely create this with front end code, and not have to deploy to a server, but I noticed that the ES Modules resulted in CORS errors in some browsers. There are local solutions for each browser, but that seemed too complicated, especially considering the timeframe. I opted to instead deploy the application on an Ubuntu server. The URL for the deployed project is: http://68.183.101.166/.
